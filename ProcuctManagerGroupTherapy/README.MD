# What?

This started out as a [ProductTankRTP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-RTP/events/257743674/) topic inspired by ... well Meetups where the networking portion of the event often devolved into a form of group therapy where we shared conversations on common pain points.

# Who?

TL;DR — Who is Dean Peters? Is a veteran agile product manager, a recovering systems programmer, servant leader, turtle herder, mountain biker, grill master, husband, and Dad. Dean also has a past life as a former professional opera singer that no one is supposed to know about, so if you can keep that last part hush-hush, it'd be appreciated.

No longer under the witness protection program, Dean can be found online at:
