# What?

This repo is where [Dean Peters](https://deanondelivery.com/) of [DeanOnDelivery.com](https://deanondelivery.com/) infamy shares slide stacks, videos, and other fun stuff related to Meetups, confrences, bloggery, and perhaps in the future webinars Dean presents.

Because some of these works enjoy continual updates and improvements, and because I always want your feedback, I thought it's be valuable to y'all to leverage GitHub.

# Who?

TL;DR — Who is Dean Peters? Is a veteran agile product manager, a recovering systems programmer, servant leader, turtle herder, mountain biker, grill master, husband, and Dad. Dean also has a past life as a former professional opera singer that no one is supposed to know about, so if you can keep that last part hush-hush, it'd be appreciated.

- Blog – https://deanondelivery.com
